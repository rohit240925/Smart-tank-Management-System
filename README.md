# Smart-tank-Management-System
This project focuses on developing a water level controller system to prevent 
water pollution caused by overflowing water tanks. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to 
monitor the water level and an ESP32 microcontroller to control the water pump. The system 
is also equipped with a flow meter to track water consumption and an LCD screen to display 
the water level. A web application is developed using HTML, CSS, and C++ to remotely 
monitor and control the water level controller system. The system is cost-effective and 
energy-efficient, which can save money and prevent unnecessary water and electricity 
consumption. The proposed system has potential applications in households, commercial 
buildings, and industries to promote sustainable water usage and prevent water pollution
